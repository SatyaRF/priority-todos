# âœ… Priority Todos: Get Real Things Done

### Goal of this app
We tend to add a lot of unnecessary tasks on our todo list and check off such
small tasks which gives us a false sense of accomplishement
even when our top priority tasks are still there on the list
untouched! This app only let's you have 4 incomplete tasks on
the list at a time, once you check off those tasks you can add
more. You can also re-arrange incomplete tasks according to your
priority. **The goal of this app is to let you mindfully choose
what tasks to focus on that are actually important!**
